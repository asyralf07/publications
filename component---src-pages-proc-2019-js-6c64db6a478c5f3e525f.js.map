Special Education is the key to increase access and\n        engagement for persons with disabilities to function in all aspects of\n        life and most importantly in the education aspects of children with\n        disabilities. Innovation in pedagogical and education methods and\n        techniques would significantly impact the lives and increase the success\n        rate for children with disabilities to experience education contexts\n        that are meaningful. Within this contention, the 3rd ICSE Conference\n        would provide the opportunity, space and a spectrum of perspectives for\n        educators and those involved in education especially in the field of\n        Special Education to share, discuss and further developing actions that\n        would enhance the lives of children with disabilities through\n        innovations that transform the landscape of Special Education. New\n        methods in teaching and learning, development of assistive devices, ICT\n        applied teaching gadget and use of cyber learning give students with\n        disabilities transformative perspectives of their own learning capacity\n        and heightened awareness of their capabilities to be successful in their\n        lives. Current development and research-based practices and models of\n        innovation in teaching and learning as well as best practices will be\n        disseminated in this conference.\n      </Typography>\n      <div className={classes.padBottom} />\n      <Typography variant=\"h6\">Theme</Typography>\n      <Typography variant=\"h7\" gutterBottom>\n        The 3rd ICSE 2019 theme is “Elevating Innovation for Sustainable\n        Development of Special Needs Education” and is presented together with\n        17 subthemes\n      </Typography>\n      <Typography variant=\"h7\" gutterBottom>\n        <ul>\n          {data.listOfSubTheme.map(s => (\n            <li>{s}</li>\n          ))}\n        </ul>\n      </Typography>\n      <Typography variant=\"h7\" gutterBottom>\n        Addressing access must be given priority and emphasis by addressing\n        opportunities and barriers such as diverse learners needs, designing and\n        implementing accommodative curriculum suited to the needs of children\n        and responsive curriculum strategies in teaching and learning.

The ICSE 2019 proceeding is the third proceeding to be published\n        and act as a continuation of the 2nd International Conference on Special\n        Education Proceedings. The papers in this proceeding are evidence of\n        research-based practices that will contribute to the building of\n        knowledge and expertise of Special Education teachers in this region and\n        beyond. SEAMEO SEN is committed to its vision and mission as a leading\n        centre of excellence in Special Education in this region. This\n        conference is a definitive effort and hard work by SEAMEO SEN to present\n        opportunities and platforms for convergence of discussion and current\n        ideas in Special Education to all its attendees. The papers published in\n        this proceeding are papers that are written and documented based on the\n        sub themes of the conference which are mainly focused on inclusive\n        education, innovations in Special Education and also on best practices\n        in all areas of Special Education. On behalf of the reviewing committee\n        team ICSE 2019, I would like to extend my appreciative note to the\n        presenters who have contributed to the papers in this proceeding. The\n        papers explicated and documented are very valuable to all Special\n        Education educators in this region and for all educators worldwide. With\n        the publication of this proceeding the papers published will be used as\n        reference and source of information for educators. I am also extending\n        my utmost appreciation to the experts of the reviewing team, the\n        technical writers and the whole team from SEAMEO SEN for the publication\n        of this proceeding. Much effort, time and technical work have been\n        invested to ensure the proceeding, will be published with standard and\n        quality. I am sure our effort will be appreciated by the end users of\n        this proceeding. I wish all the presenters and writers the best of luck\n        in their future undertakings. Working within the Special Education field\n        in the 21st century is indeed very challenging. The papers documented in\n        this proceeding is the evidence of passion and love that we have for the\n        betterment of our children with Special Education Needs. May all of us\n        continue to work harder and become more resilient in our endeavour to\n        champion the cause for our Special Children in this region. Together, we\n        strive for excellence. Mdm. Hjh.
